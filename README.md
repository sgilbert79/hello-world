# hello-world
## I am totally new to Git.  I am trying to learn how to use it effectively.  About damn time!!
**This is my start.  I am in my 40s and finally deciding what I want to be when I grow up!!**

###*I hope that the people with which I collaborate and who help me along, will continue to push me and challenge me to get better every day.  I owe it to my family and my fellow man.*

**##THAT SAID, I AM TAKING ALL SUGGESTIONS AND APPRECIATE ANY HELP!**
